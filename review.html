                <p>“I just wanted to send you a quick message to say a huge thank you for last weekend. You were absolutely amazing and exactly what we were looking for in a wedding band! All our guests thought you were fab and are still talking about how brilliant you were - especially 86 year old Auntie Maureen who was up dancing for most of the evening!! Thank you for being so helpful and flexible, especially as it was so last minute (still can't believe you were actually available!). Can't wait to have another party so we can book you again!!”</p>

Their communication skills are great and they cannot do enough for you. I would highly recommend them and if you are wanting a band that gets people up dancing and joining in then look no further! We absolutely look forward to having them and feel like we have become firm friends!”</p>
